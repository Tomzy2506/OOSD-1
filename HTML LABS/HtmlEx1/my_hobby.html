                <p>There are many different dance styles but I am mainly focused on hip-hop and afrobeats.
                Few years ago, my family and I learned how to salsa but we have become rusty.<br>
                I make vidoes on <a href = "https://www.tiktok.com/@bxllerina.t">tikok</a> and <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/its_tomiwaa/">instagram</a> dancing for fun to mostly African and American songs.
                My inspirations are "R mvmnt" a ghanaian dance group based worldwide and Chris Brown.
